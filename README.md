# Classification

Hi

Thanks for visiting my Classification respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use classification to predict 
1. species of flower using the iris dataset
2. if its going to rain tomorrow in Rain in Australia with logistic regression
3. if its going to rain tomorrow in Rain in Australia with decision tree and random foresting

The tutorials for first 3 datasets were from freecodecamp.
