# Classification

Hi

Thanks for visiting my Classification respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use classification to identify 
1. species of flower using the iris dataset
2. predict if its going to rain tomorrow in Rain in Australia with logistic regression
3. predict if its going to rain tomorrow in Rain in Australia with decision tree and random foresting
4. predict hate speech, offensive language or neither by using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count as a feature. 

The tutorials for first 3 datasets were from freecodecamp
